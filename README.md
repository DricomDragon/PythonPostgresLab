# PythonPostgresLab
A CLI (Command Line Interface) written in python to query a PostgreSQL database. Lab realized as a student at Ecole Centrale de Nantes (ECN).

## Prerequisites

### PyInquirer

For easy CLI python interfaces :
`sudo pip3 install pyinquirer`

### Postgres

To install PostgreSQL driver :
`sudo pip3 install postgres`

## PostgreSQL database

I suppose that you already have a running instance of postgreSQL. The schema is a model of a logistics company.
